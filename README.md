**Smart AWS Cost Optimizer**

A Python-based tool that analyzes AWS billing data and provides cost-saving recommendations using AWS Cost Explorer.

🚀 Overview

Managing cloud costs efficiently is crucial for optimizing expenses. This project helps identify unused AWS resources, analyze spending trends, and suggest potential savings.

Features:

✅ Fetch AWS cost usage data via Cost Explorer API✅ Identify unused EC2 instances to reduce unnecessary spending✅ Generate automated cost insights (AI-powered analysis planned)✅ Cost breakdown by AWS services (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda)✅ Automate reports using AWS Lambda & Slack alerts (Planned)✅ AI-powered cost recommendations using OpenAI (Planned)

🔧 Setup & Installation

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/sbattu96/aws-cost-optimizer.git
cd aws-cost-optimizer

2️⃣ Set Up a Virtual Environment

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install boto3 pandas openai

4️⃣ Configure AWS CLI

Ensure AWS CLI is installed and configured:

aws configure

Enter your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, Region (us-east-1 or your preferred region), and output format (json).

🛠 Usage

Run the Cost Analysis Script

python cost_optimizer.py

This will fetch AWS cost data and list unused EC2 instances.

📌 Example Output

AWS Cost Report:
Time Period: 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-31 - Cost: $150.25
Unused EC2 Instances: i-0abcd1234xyz, i-0efgh5678uvw

🛠 Future Enhancements

🔹 Breakdown cost by AWS service (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS)🔹 AI-powered recommendations for cost optimization🔹 Automate reports using AWS Lambda & Slack notifications🔹 Build a Web Dashboard (Streamlit/Flask) for cost visualization
